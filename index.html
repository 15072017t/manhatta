    <h1>Manhattan</h1>

    <p>Manhattan is the oldest and most densely populated of the five boroughs that make up New York City. Located
      primarily on Manhattan Island, which is at the mouth of the Hudson River, the borough's boundaries coincide with
      those of New York County, an original county in the state of New York. Manhattan and New York County consist of
      Manhattan Island and several other small adjacent islands: Roosevelt Island, Randall's Island, Wards Island,
      Governor's Island, Liberty Island, part of Ellis Island,[3] and U Thant Island; as well as Marble Hill, a small
      continental section of land, adjacent to the Bronx. New York City began at the southern tip of Manhattan, expanded
      north, and then, between 1874 and 1898, incorporated land from neighboring counties.

      Manhattan has an area of ​​58.7 km²,[1] a population of 1,694,251 inhabitants, and a population density of
      28,873.0 inhabitants/km² (according to the 2020 national census[2]). New York County is one of the smallest
      counties in the United States by land area and the most densely populated in the country. It is the third most
      populous county in the state and the 20th most populous in the United States.

      Manhattan was founded in 1683. Two of New York's three financial centers are located in Manhattan. The
      neighborhood is home to the city's main points of interest, including Times Square, Central Park, the Empire State
      Building, Wall Street, Broadway and the Brooklyn Bridge, the bridge that connects Manhattan to Brooklyn, and was
      also home to, before 9/11. attacks, the famous World Trade Center complex, currently under reconstruction,
      although One World Trade Center and other buildings have already been opened.</p>

    <h1>Salvador</h1>
  </main>
  <p>Salvador, initially São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos, is a Brazilian municipality, capital of the state of
    Bahia and the first capital of Brazil. Founded on March 29, 1549 by Tomé de Sousa, due to the implementation of the
    General Government of Brazil by the Portuguese Empire,[8] the city is among the oldest on the American continent and
    is one of the first planned cities in the world, still in the Renaissance period.[9][10] The African influence on
    many cultural aspects of the city makes it the center of Afro-Brazilian culture.[11][12][13] Salvador is still
    notable throughout the country for its gastronomy, music and architecture,[14] which are also recognized
    internationally.

    Centralization as capital along with Lusitanian colonization were important factors in shaping the municipality's
    profile, as were certain geographic characteristics. Located on the Brazilian coast and in the Zona da Mata of the
    Northeast Region of Brazil, it is part of Recôncavo Baiano. The construction of the city took place following the
    rugged topography, initially with the formation of two levels (Cidade Alta and Cidade Baixa) on a steep cliff[10]
    and, later, with the design of valley avenues.[15][16] ] With an area of ​​693,442 square kilometers,[1] its
    emerging territory is peninsular and the coastline is bordered by the Baía de Todos os Santos to the west and the
    Atlantic Ocean to the east.[17][18] The Historic Center of Salvador, iconized on the outskirts of Largo do
    Pelourinho, is known for its Portuguese colonial architecture with historical monuments dating from the 17th century
    to the beginning of the 20th century, having been declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational
    Organization , Science and Culture (Unesco) in 1985. Stage of one of the biggest carnivals in the world (largest
    street party in the world, according to the Guinness Book),[19][20][21][22] the integration of the municipality to
    the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as "City of Music", a unique title in the country, increased international
    recognition for Salvador's music</p>
